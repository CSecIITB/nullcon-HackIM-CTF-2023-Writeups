# U Do Pee?

## Challenge Description

There was weird traffic on port 10000. Apparently employee 'astroza' tried to bypass our firewall restrictions using a udptunnel tool obtained from GitHub. They said we won't be able to see the traffic, since the tool configures a 'password' to run.

What was the employee trying to download to their computer?
