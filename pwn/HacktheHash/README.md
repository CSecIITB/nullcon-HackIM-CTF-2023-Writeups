# Hack the Hash

The binary is a stripped binary. The function at `0x000013d6` is the main function.
The function at `0x00001329` ensures that username is not gehaxelt and compares hash of password with a hard coded hash.
The function creates a 0x12 byte space for storing the SHA-1 hash of the password entered and a variable which stores 0 if the user is authorized.
The variable is initialized with 0x1337, which makes first 2 bytes of variable 0.
If we enter a password with SHA-1 hash ending in 2 0 bytes, the check variable is overwritten with 0, thus authorizing the user.

One may use the following  script to get such a password.
```python
i=0
while True:
    if sha1(int.to_bytes(i,(int)(i**0.5+1),'little')).digest()[-2:] == b'\x00\x00':
        print(int.to_bytes(i,(int)(math.log(i)/math.log(256))+1,'big'))
        break
    i+=1
```

We get the flag:
**ENO{C_H4SHing_1s_H4rd:D}**
